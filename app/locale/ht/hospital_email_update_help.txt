REFERENCE DOCUMENT

To update a hospital via email, you can either draft a new email or reply to an update you received with changed information.

Each hospital must start with a line in the following format:

update General Hospital (haiti:example.org/123)

Here, "haiti:example.org/123" is the unique key of "General Hospital". The key of the hospital "haiti:example.org/123" is not strictly required if the title is supplied. Each line that follows must start with the name of an attribute, followed by a space, and then the new value for that attribute. A complete list of attribute names is included below. For example, to update the number of total and available beds for a hospital, type:

update General Hospital (haiti:example.org/123)
Total beds 500
Available beds 79
