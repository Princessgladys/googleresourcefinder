To update a facility via email, you can either draft a new email or reply to an update you received with changed information.

Each facility must start with a line in the following format:

update General Hospital

Here, "example.org/123" is the unique key of "General Hospital". The key of the facility "example.org/123" is not strictly required if the title is supplied. Each line that follows must start with the name of an attribute, followed by a space, and then the new value for that attribute. A complete list of attribute names is included below. For example, to update the number of total and available beds for a facility, type:

update General Hospital
Total beds 500
Available beds 79

An update email for two facilities might look like the following:

update General Hospital
Total beds 37
Available beds 10
Contact name John Smith

update Public Hospital
Reachable by road yes
