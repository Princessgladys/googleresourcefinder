To update a facility via email, you can either draft a new email or reply to an update you received with changed information.

Each update must start with a line in the following format:

update General Hospital

Here, General Hospital is the title of the facility to be updated. Each line that follows the initial update line must start with the name of an attribute, followed by a space, and then the new value for that attribute. A complete list of attribute names is included below. For example, to update the number of total and available beds for a facility, type:

update General Hospital
Total beds 500
Available beds 79

An update email for two facilities might look like the following:

update General Hospital
Total beds 37
Available beds 10
Email test@example.com

update Public Hospital
