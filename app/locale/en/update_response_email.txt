REFERENCE DOCUMENT

To update a facility via email, you can either draft a new email or reply to an update you received with changed information.

When creating a new email, each subject must start with a line in the following format:

UPDATE Title Foo (haiti 123)

where “haiti 123” is the subdomain and HealthCID of the facility. All following lines must start with an attribute, followed by a space, and then the new value for that attribute. For example, to update the total and available number of beds for a facility, you would include the lines:

Total beds 500
Available beds 79

An update email for two facilities might look like the following:

UPDATE (haiti 123)
Total beds 37
Available beds 10
Contact name Person Foo

UPDATE (haiti 456)
reachable_by_road yes

Text updates [can contain any character; letter, number, etc.]:
    Contact name: The primary contact of the facility
    Phone: The primary phone number of the facility
    Email: The primary email contact of the facility
    Department: The facility's department name
    District: The facility's district name
    Commune: The facility's commune name
    Address: The facility's address
    Organization: The facility's organization name
    Damage: Description of any damage done to the facility

Number updates [must be integers only]:
    Available beds: The number of available beds at the facility
    Total beds: The total number of beds at the facility

Yes/No updates [value must be either yes or no]:
    Reachable by road: Whether or not the facility is reachable by road
    Can pick up patients: Whether or not the facility can pick up patients
